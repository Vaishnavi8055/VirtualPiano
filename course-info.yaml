summary: One of the many things that a front-end developer has to take care of is
  binding the functionality of the web application to the keys on the keyboard. The
  mouse is easy to operate, but it's not enough, because some things are more convenient
  to do with the keyboard — for example, refresh a page in the browser. It is also
  very important to make your product available to a variety of users, including those
  with physical disabilities. People with poor eyesight and/or impaired fine motor
  skills learn about the content of sites literally through touch. Switching between
  keyboard and mouse plays a vital role when using programs to sound text on the screen
  and navigating sites. These programs make the information on the web more accessible
  for people with disabilities. In order to develop and strengthen the important skills
  of working with keyboard keys, in this project we will make a virtual piano — perhaps
  this is one of the most creative and enjoyable ways to learn!<br/><br/>Learn more
